## Introduction

Overlap is an AI video marketing agent that can completely automate your video clipping and social media posting.

Our agent understands your style and will learn what's performing well on socials, improving itself over time.

## System Requirements

Overlap runs **entirely in the browser** and relies on **Web Codecs** for smooth, low-latency video playback and editing. That means you must use a **browser + version that supports Web Codecs**, on a device that can handle hardware-accelerated video decoding.

### Browser Requirements (Web Codecs support)

We recommend **Chrome** (or **Edge**) for the most consistent experience.

| Browser | Web Codecs Support | Minimum Version |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Google Chrome | ✅ Supported | **94+** |
| Microsoft Edge (Chromium) | ✅ Supported | **94+** |
| Mozilla Firefox | ✅ Supported | **130+** |
| Opera | ✅ Supported | **80+** |
| Safari (macOS / iOS) | ✅ Supported | **26.0+** |

> Notes:
> - Ensure your browser version is at least what is defined above.

### Download Links (Supported Browsers)

- **Google Chrome (recommended)**: https://www.google.com/chrome/  
- **Microsoft Edge**: https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download  
- **Mozilla Firefox**: https://www.firefox.com/  
- **Opera**: https://www.opera.com/download  
- **Safari (update via macOS update)**: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102665  
- **Safari Technology Preview (optional, for newest WebKit features)**: https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/

### Operating System Requirements

Your OS must support hardware-accelerated video decoding.

**Supported**
- **macOS**: 11 (Big Sur) or newer  
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or newer (64-bit)
- **Linux**: Modern distributions with GPU acceleration enabled

**Not supported**
- ❌ iOS / iPadOS browsers for production workflows (may work on newer versions, but not recommended for editing)
- ❌ Android browsers for production workflows
- ❌ Older/unsupported OS versions without modern GPU decode

### Hardware Requirements

Because video decoding and rendering happen locally, your device must be capable of handling modern codecs efficiently.

**Minimum**
- **CPU**: Intel i5 / Apple Silicon M1 / AMD Ryzen 5 (or equivalent)
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **GPU**: Integrated GPU with hardware video decode support

**Recommended**
- **CPU**: Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or modern Intel i7 / Ryzen 7
- **RAM**: 16 GB
- **GPU**: Dedicated GPU or Apple Silicon media engine

> If your machine is below minimum specs, you may see choppy playback, lag when scrubbing, or export instability.

### Network Requirements

- **Stable broadband connection**
- Recommended: **25 Mbps down / 10 Mbps up**
- Wired or strong Wi-Fi preferred during editing sessions

Uploads, downloads, and AI processing all rely on a consistent connection.

### Quick Checks

**Check your browser version**
- Chrome: `chrome://version`
- Edge: `edge://version`
- Firefox: Menu → Help → About Firefox
- Safari: Safari → About Safari

**Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled (Chrome/Edge)**
- Settings → System → **Use hardware acceleration when available**
