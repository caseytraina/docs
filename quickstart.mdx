#### Optionally, Link your YouTube

You can connect a YouTube account to automatically clip new content and add it to your dashboard. For example, when you publish your new podcast episode, your agent will download this, clip it, prepare post, and can even share them immediately.

1. Select the YouTube logo
2. Paste the full channel URL (with the @username in the URL)

## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter with the web editor.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I logged in. Why aren't my clips here?">
    **Possible causes:**

    - Your account is still being set up. It takes around 30 seconds for your initial workflow to appear in _<u>Workflows</u>_
    - Your workflow is still running and clips will appear in 5-10 minutes (\+ you'll receive an email)
    - Your workflow hasn't been run yet

    **Solutions:**

    1. Go to _<u>Workflows</u>_
    2. If you have a default workflow and it _isn't_ highlighted in blue, then press on it
    3. Drop in a URL and press **Launch**. Your clips will be ready in 5-10 minutes.
