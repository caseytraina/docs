### Sample Response (Not Completed)

```json
{
  "clips": [],
  "status": "Processing"
}
```

- `clips` (array) — List of result clips when `status` is `"Completed"`. Empty array otherwise.
- `status` (string) — Current state of the workflow run. One of:
  - \`"pending"
  - `"Processing"`
  - `"Learning"`
  - `"Completed"`
  - `"Error"`

We recommended polling this endpoint in a backoff loop.
