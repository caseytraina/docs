  ### Schema

  - **Input**: The URL to the RSS Feed
  - **Output**: The new audio or video episode
</Info>

<Warning>
  If this is an Audio-only podcast, we will add a black screen as a video. We suggest adding a [audiogram](/nodes/audiogram) node to your workflow to add visuals
</Warning>

When a workflow is activated with a _RSS Feed _trigger, we will start listening to the feed for changes, polling every hour. We will ingest only the entries of the last 12 hours that have not yet been ingested.

You can find all of the nodes in the left sidebar
