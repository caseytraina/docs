<Info>
  ### Schema

  - **Input**: The direct stream URL (.m3u8)
  - **Output**: 30-minute chunks of the stream
</Info>

When a workflow is activated with an _Audio Stream_ trigger, we will start recording the audio in 30-minute chunks, and sending it to trigger the workflow. We can only start from the moment it is activated.

You can find all of the nodes in the left sidebar
