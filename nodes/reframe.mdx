<Warning>
  For the vast majority clips, Split View will be the optimal choice for a reframe algorithm. This process will add approximately 5 minutes onto your workflow run time.

  ### Schema

  - **Reframe Style**
</Info>

## Style Descriptions

- **Split View:**\
  Dynamically determines who is speaking, tracks their face and body, and can handle multiple simultaneous speakers
- **Centered:**\
  Will take a horizontal video and place it in a vertical frame with padding. You may customize the position and the amount of zoom.
- **Face Tracking:**\
  _Deprecated_. This model uses face detection with **no active speaker detection**. Good for single speakers but still recommended to use Split View.
- **Custom:**\
  For enterprise customers who will have custom styling. Defaults to a "Streamer" template for Twitch streams, centering faces on top of the main content.
