## Prompting Best Practices

To get the most relevant and engaging clips from your videos, it’s important to give the agent clear and focused instructions. Here are some best practices:

- **Be Specific About What You Want:**\
  Mention the kind of moments you’re looking for, such as “every time the guest pitches their company”, “all commentary on stock market movement”, “when people start laughing"
- **Reference Context or Topics:**\
  If your video covers different topics, specify which sections or themes are most valuable (e.g., “clips about startup advice” or “moments discussing AI trends”).
- **Audience Matters:**\
  Tell the agent who the clips are for, such as “Gen Z viewers on TikTok” or “business professionals on LinkedIn.” This helps tailor the selection to the right style and platform.
- **Use Example Prompts:**
  - “Find the most insightful moments where the guest shares actionable advice.”
  - “Highlight the funniest reactions and meme-worthy moments.”
  - “Surface powerful quotes and viral soundbites”
- **Avoid Overly Broad Requests:**\
  Instead of “find good clips,” try to narrow it down to what defines a “good” clip for your content and audience.
- **Review and Refine:**\
  After seeing the agent’s results, refine your prompt based on what worked and what didn’t. Iterative prompting often yields the best highlights.
