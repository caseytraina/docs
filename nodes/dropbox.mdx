<Info>
  ### Schema

  - **Input**: A dropbox folder to listen to
  - **Output**: The newly uploaded dropbox video
</Info>

When a workflow is activated with a _New Dropbox Video_ trigger, we will start listening for file changes. When _any_ file is added in the folder, we will ingest **all unused videos.** This includes videos that were previously in the folder.

You can find all of the nodes in the left sidebar
