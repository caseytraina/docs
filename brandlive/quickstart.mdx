This guide walks through the full Brandlive → Overlap flow:

1. Triggering the agent
2. Poll for status and retrieve clips
3. Preview and display subtitles over video using `<Subtitles />`
4. Re-render the clip after changes
5. Return the file result to the user

<Info>
  When creating initial clipping agents, lean on your Overlap team to support you.

  Each clipping agent will need to include every desired editable field as a node. For example, if you _ever_ want to control the subtitles via the trigger API, then you will need to include a Subtitles node in your agent.
</Info>

## 1. Trigger an Agent (Start Clip Generation)

Before triggering an agent (a.k.a a Workflow), you'll need to find the `workflowId`. This is most easily obtained from the URL when you are looking at a clipping agent. The URL will be structured as follows:

`https://portal.overlap.ai/workflows/<Workflow ID>/trigger`

</Frame>

Use `POST /trigger-template` to start the clipping process from a long-form video URL.

> **Required fields:** `companyId`, `workflowId`, `url`

```http
POST https://api.joinoverlap.com/trigger-template
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "companyId": "brandlive-prod",
  "workflowId": "webinar-template",
  "url": "https://brandlive-cdn.com/webinars/session123.mp4", // Input url of the long form video
  "broll": true
}
```

<Info>
  This will launch a clipping agent with the exact same settings as what appears in the clipping agent in Overlap, except with B Roll turned ON.
</Info>

**Sample Response**

```json
{
  "triggerId": "c1a27b63-91d9-45fb-9c89-5f418442fb6e",
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Workflow triggered successfully."
}
```

Save `triggerId` — you will use it in the next step.

---

## 2. Poll for Status and Retrieve Clips

Use `GET /workflow-results/{triggerId}` to check the status every 5–10 seconds until clips are ready.

```http
GET https://api.joinoverlap.com/workflow-results/{triggerId}
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Example (JavaScript, simple polling)**

```ts
async function pollForResults(triggerId: string) {
  const baseUrl = "https://api.joinoverlap.com/workflow-results";

  while (true) {
    const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/${triggerId}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OVERLAP_API_KEY!}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
    });

    const data = await res.json();

    if (data.status === "Completed") {
      return data.clips; // Clip[]
    }

    if (data.status === "Error") {
      throw new Error(data.error ?? "Unknown Overlap error");
    }

    // queued | running → wait and try again
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
  }
}
```

**Sample Completed Response (simplified)**

```json
{
  "status": "Completed",
  "clips": [
    {
      "id": "clip-123",
      "title": "Product Launch Highlights",
      "bio": "Key moments from the Brandlive webinar.",
      "renderedUrl": // The url of the video without subtitles,
      "thumbnailUrl": "https://cdn.overlap.ai/thumbnails/clip-123.jpg",
      "transcriptUrl": "https://cdn.overlap.ai/transcripts/clip-123.json",
      "duration": 42.1,
      "aspectRatio": "9:16"
		.... see /brandlive/trigger for remaining fields
    }
  ]
}
```

Pick a clip (e.g., `clips[0]`) to preview and edit.

## 3. Preview Video With \<Subtitles /\>

An overlay component to display on top of the `renderedUrl` to simulate and edit subtitles

```jsx
import { Subtitles } from "@overlap.ai/react-video-subtitles";
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export function ClipPreview({ clip, apiKey, companyId }) {
  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
	...

  return (
    <div className="relative w-full">
      <video
        ref={videoRef}
        src={clip.renderedUrl}
        className="w-full h-auto"
        controls
      />

      {/* Transparent overlay */}
      <div
        className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none"
        style={{ width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
      >
        <Subtitles
          words={clip.words}          // word-level timing, obtained from wordTranscriptJSON provided in the clip document
          currentTime={currentTime}
          width={WIDTH}
          height={HEIGHT}
          apiKey={apiKey}
          companyId={companyId}
          clipId={clip.id}            // loads styleConfig automatically, optionally override
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Font sizing now uses standard dimensions, not your video size

## 4. Re-render After Edits

Once the user adjusts subtitles or trims, you can re-render the clip by calling `POST /render` with `clipId`.

```http
POST https://api.joinoverlap.com/render
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "companyId": "brandlive-prod",
  "clipId": "clip-123"
}
```

**Sample Response**

```json
{
  "url": // Finalized url with subtitles burnt in.
}
```

- Endpoint runs **synchronously**
- Approximate runtime: `clip_duration_seconds * 0.75`

## Summary

1. **Trigger** `POST /trigger-template` with `companyId`, `workflowId`, `url`
2. **Poll** `GET /workflow-results/{taskId}` until `status === "completed"`
3. **Preview** video + subtitles using `<Subtitles />` and the transcript from `transcriptUrl`
4. **Re-render** with `POST /render` after edits are made
5. **Display** final `url` in your Brandlive experience
