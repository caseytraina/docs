### Endpoint

```http
POST https://api.joinoverlap.com/render
```

This endpoint renders an existing clip when changes are made on the frontend (e.g., subtitle edits, trimming adjustments). This process runs synchronously and will take about 20 seconds + 50% of the video length

### Authentication

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

---

## Request Body

```json
{
  "companyId": "string",
  "clipId": "string" // As obtained from the clip document in /workflow-results
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| `companyId` | string | Organization identifier     |
| `clipId`    | string | ID of the clip to re-render |

---

## Response

```json
{
 	"status": "finished" | "failed" | "rendering",
	"renderUrl": "string",
	"error": // if relevant
	"code": // Specific error event, if relevant
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| Field       | Type   | Description                    |

## Performance & Behavior
