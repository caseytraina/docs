## What is a workflow?

A _workflow_ in Overlap is an automated series of steps that takes your raw video from upload to finished, ready-to-publish content—without manual intervention.

Workflows coordinate everything from AI-powered clip detection and editing, to adding subtitles, overlays, and branding.

With workflows, you can define, customize, and automate your entire video production process, ensuring consistent results at scale while freeing your team from repetitive tasks.

## An Example

Below is a workflow with two <u>branches.</u> The workflow is started via the YouTube <u>Trigger </u>-- when a new YouTube video is added to my channel.

One branch creates horizontal videos with subtitles. Another creates vertical clips with <u>Smart Zoom</u>

### What is a Branch?

A **branch** in a workflow is a point where your automated process can split and perform multiple actions at the same time or take different paths based on certain conditions.

For example, after a video is clipped, one branch of your workflow might add subtitles while another branch resizes the video for different platforms. Branches help you run several tasks in parallel or customize the workflow to fit your unique needs—all within a single, streamlined process.

#### What is a Node?

A **node** in a workflow is a single step or action that performs a specific task in your automated process.

Each node represents an operation, like uploading a video, generating a clip, adding subtitles, or publishing to social media. By connecting nodes together, you define the sequence and logic of your workflow. Think of nodes as building blocks—each one handles one part of the job, and together they create the full, automated workflow.

You can find all of the nodes in the left sidebar

### Output

Any finished result from your workflow—like a completed video or clip—is automatically saved to your library. You don’t have to do anything extra; as soon as a process finishes, the result is stored and ready for you to use, share, or publish.

Any node with _No Output Connection_ is considered the "end" and will be saved. Above, the _Add Subtitles_ and the _Smart Zoom_ nodes are considered the end nodes.

## Saving & Activating

<Info>
  The number of allowed and activated workflows will vary by subscription plan. Free plans may have 3 activated workflows simultaneously
</Info>

**Save to Draft** will save your workflow as it is, but it won’t run or start any actions yet. You may still run this workflow via the Launcher

**Save and Activate** will save your workflow and turn on the Trigger node, so your workflow will start running automatically whenever its conditions are met.

## Trigger Workflow

When you click on a workflow, you’ll be taken to the Launcher UI. Here, you can simply drop in a URL or upload a file, then hit **Launch** to start the workflow instantly.
