> Posting too much or at the wrong times can _hurt_ your profile.

## Consider the time

If posting manually, consider the behavior of your audience.

If you're based on the east coast of the US, then it would make the most sense to post before bed (7-10PM EST), before work (5-8AM EST), or at lunch time (12-2PM EST).

Posts are prioritized in social algorithms based on the initial interaction they receive on the for-you algorithm. Give yourself a better chance by posting at peak times.

## TikTok

- TikTok does not currently support line breaks in the post text. Included line breaks will be ignored.
- 20 videos per day (with a rate limit of 2 videos per minute). This is a hard limit.

### Video Limits

- Max video size: 1 GB.
- Max Duration: 600 seconds.
- Min Duration: 3 seconds.

## YouTube

<Warning>
  YouTube posting requires your YouTube account to have at least one Channel and be an owner on the Channel. To create a YouTube Channel, click on your profile in the YouTube Dashboard and choose “Create a Channel”.

  You may also use this direct link to create a YouTube Channel: [**http://m.youtube.com/create_channel**](http://m.youtube.com/create_channel)
</Warning>

- Max video size: 4 GB.

The `title` must be 100 characters or less. The `post` must be 5,000 characters or less. The `post` and `title` may contain any characters except \< and \>.

### Limits:

- Depending on a creator’s location, a channel might be able to increase their daily limit by getting access to advanced features.
