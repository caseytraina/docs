To link your account, press on _Linked Accounts_ in the left sidebar and select the desired platform. You will be rerouted to a third party account linking service and once your account is linked, you may return to this page.

<Warning>
  If linking an Instagram account, it must be a business or creator account and linked to a Facebook page.
