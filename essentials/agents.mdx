## What is a social agent?

A **social agent** is an automated tool that creates and publishes posts to your social media accounts for you. 

Once set up, the agent can watch for new content (like a new episode or video), then automatically generate and schedule posts according to your settings—such as how often to post, which accounts to use, and which workflow to follow. 

You can even add language instructions to control the style or key points of each post. This means you can keep your social channels active and consistent, without manual effort for every post.

## An Example

Below shows how you can set up a social posting agent to automate your content distribution. 

Here, the agent is configured to monitor the “Theo” workflow for new podcast episodes. Whenever a new episode is detected, the agent will automatically generate and **post up to** **three** YouTube Shorts **each day for three days** to the selected YouTube account.

You can also provide detailed language **instructions** to guide how the agent **writes captions**—for example, making sure the posts are punchy, meme-able, and tailored to Gen Z, with a style and tone that matches the creator’s brand.

This lets the agent handle not only the timing and channel of your posts, but also the voice and content style, so you can consistently publish engaging, on-brand social content without manual effort.

## Setting up an Agent

Press _<u>Social Agents</u>_ in the sidebar, followed by **Create Agent**.

When creating an agent, you may designate a workflow for it to connect to, a platform and account for it to post to, a frequency for it to post at, and language for it to post with.

## View Outgoing Posts

<Info>
  Once a post has been scheduled, you must manually delete it if you wish for it not to go out. Turning off the agent will **not** remove existing scheduled posts.
</Info>

Find the _<u>Social Calendar</u>_ in the left sidebar to view outgoing posts.

Green posts represent your history of what has already been shared. Grey represents posts that are scheduled. For example, on May 23rd, we have 14 TikToks scheduled to post.

<Tip>
  You may edit the text or timing of a scheduled post by pressing on a specific day. The video will show any edits you have made and when the post is shared, we will share the most <u>up-to-date version.</u>

## View Social Performance

Select _<u>Social Analytics</u>_ in the left sidebar to view your performance across social profiles. 

Platforms update their statistics at different times. YouTube, for example, is often two days delayed.

<Warning>
  If you do not see analytics for a platform that is connected, this could be because your platform has not reached the minimum threshold.

  - The following platforms are currently supported: Facebook Pages, Instagram, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Threads, TikTok, and YouTube.
  - For TikTok analytics access, account owners must: 

    1. Publish at least one video. 

    2. Tap the "Turn On" button on the Analytics page of their mobile TikTok app. 

    3. Have 100 followers to receive additional insights about viewers and content engagement.
</Warning>
