> Automated your posting across socials

## What is a posting persona?

Think of a **posting persona** as the social media manager you would hire. You give them a personality, calls-to-action, accounts to mention, restrictions, and more.

These posting personas become the engine of your social media auto-posting and suggested post copy.

You can even add language instructions to control the style or key points of each post. This means you can keep your social channels active and consistent, without manual effort for every post.

## Creating your First Persona

To find your personas, go to _Posting Personas_ in the left sidebar.

Once here, press "Create New Persona"

As you'll see, you now have the ability to specify a name, a prompt, target platforms, and more. When drafting your prompt, consider who you would want to hire to be your social media manager: would you want a satirical, Gen-Z college student who specializes in TikTok content, or would you want an industry veteran who focuses on professional, enterprise marketing?

_Click "Generate Avatar" if you wish to generate a headshot for your new social media manager\!_

## Previewing your Persona

As you're building out your prompt, it's good practice to preview your post content to ensure it aligns with what you want.

Click _Preview Content_ in the top right to see what your agent would produce for a given clip. If your profile already has clips, then we will take the most recent clip as an example. If your account does _not_ have clips, then we will select a boilerplate public Overlap clip to see the example output.

We recommend building out a [Clipping Agent](/essentials/workflows) first, so you can generate clips and test on your own content\!
