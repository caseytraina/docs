## Provide Rules

Constrain the agent's behavior by providing comprehensive rules. Focus on high-level behavior which will elicit proper behavior downstream. For the purpose of finding clips, provide rules that clearly outline what makes a good clip vs. a bad clip.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rules (with Markdown)">
    ```markdown
    ## Rules
    
    ### Content Guidelines:
    
    - **Focus on moments that are:**
      * Counterintuitive insights that challenge common marketing beliefs
      * Actionable tips or frameworks that viewers can implement immediately
      * Engaging stories or case studies that illustrate a marketing principle
      * Bold statements or hot takes that provoke thought and discussion
    
    - **Clips must be self-contained:**
      * The viewer should grasp the context and takeaway without needing additional information
      * Avoid clips that rely heavily on prior segments or external references
    
    - **Prioritize:**
      * High-quality audio with clear speech
      * Content that reflects the channel's commitment to providing valuable marketing insights
      * Moments that showcase the unique perspectives of the host and guests
    
    ### Technical Guidelines:
    
    - **NEVER clip:**
      * Commercials, sponsorships, or ad reads
    
    - **Formatting:**
      * Ensure the clip starts with a strong hook—a question, bold statement, or intriguing fact—to capture attention within the first 3 seconds
      * End with a clear takeaway or call-to-action that encourages further engagement or reflection

## Finish with a Reminder

Like humans, LLMs tend to have a slight preference towards what comes at the beginning and end of their prompt. So, just as you start with the goal, you should end with it too.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are guardrails so important for voice agents?">
    Voice interactions tend to be more free-form and unpredictable than text. Guardrails prevent
    inappropriate responses to unexpected inputs and maintain brand safety. They're essential for
    voice agents that represent organizations or provide sensitive advice.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I update the prompt after deployment?">
    Yes. The system prompt can be modified at any time to adjust behavior. This is particularly useful
    for addressing emerging issues or refining the agent's capabilities as you learn from user
    interactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle users with different speaking styles or accents?">
    Design your prompt with simple, clear language patterns and instruct the agent to ask for
    clarification when unsure. Avoid idioms and region-specific expressions that might confuse STT
    systems processing diverse accents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I make the AI sound more conversational?">
    Include speech markers (brief affirmations, filler words) in your system prompt. Specify that the
    AI can use interjections like "Hmm," incorporate thoughtful pauses, and employ natural speech
    patterns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does a longer system prompt guarantee better results?">
    No. Focus on quality over quantity. Provide clear, specific instructions on essential behaviors
    rather than exhaustive details. Test different prompt lengths to find the optimal balance for your
    specific use case.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I balance consistency with adaptability?">
    Define core personality traits and guardrails firmly while allowing flexibility in tone and
    verbosity based on the user's communication style. This creates a recognizable character that
    can still respond naturally to different situations.
