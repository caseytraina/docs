<Update label="October 19" tags={["Improvements"]} rss={{ title: "Weekly Updates", description: "Rendering improvements, reframing enhancements, agent upgrades, and bug fixes" }}>
  ## Rendering Improvements

  - We've significantly overhauled our rendering infrastructure to allow for faster and higher quality downloads
  - Videos can now export at up to 4K @ 60 fps, in less than half of the video's duration

  ## Reframing Enhancements

  - Users may now resize the crop boxes for split crop in the reframe editor
  - Any video reframed using our "Split View" style will have the ability to edit the reframe positioning when using our editor
  - You can now select from three styles: Single, Split, and Padded crops
  - You can zoom in/out for Single and Split crop

  ## Agent Upgrades

  - It is no longer required to call "Find Clips" in an agent
  - Agents may take in a clip as input and be used for styling and/or scheduling
  - For example, users may put cut clips into a dropbox folder and allow Overlap to add subtitles then send it to multiple platforms.

  ## Color Themes

  - We now have Light, Sand, Dark, and Midnight color themes available by pressing the Sun icon in the sidebar
